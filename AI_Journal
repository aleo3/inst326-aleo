Week 1
This week I used AI while working on the week exercise to remind me how to use f strings. I did not use AI to complete or debug any of the exercise.
I used Chatgpt, but they did not have a link I could copy, but what I asked was "f strings in python" and it only gave me examples of how they are used/formatted.

Week 2
This week I used AI while working on the week exercise to refresh what I learned in class about the programming syntax and organization while writing conditionals and loops. Since I have only really done java before, but I find that java and python are pretty similar. I did not use AI to complete of debug any of the exercise.
I used Chatgpt, but they did not have a link that I could copy, but what I asked was "how is for loops and if statements written in python" and it showed me examples of code.

Week 3
This week I used Ai while working on the week exercise to debug a couple times when I had an error and I was kind of confused what the error was.
I used Chatgpt, but they did not have a link that I could copy, but I put the line of code that was giving error and I would explain to Chatgpt what the error was saying and it would make suggestions to what the error was, which was sometimes wrong, but at least I figured it out.
