Week 1
This week I used AI while working on this weeks exercise to remind me how to use f strings. I did not use AI to complete or debug any of the exercise.
I used Chatgpt, but they did not have a link I could copy, but what I asked was "f strings in python" and it only gave me examples of how they are used/formatted.

Week 2
This week I used AI while working on this weeks exercise to refresh what I learned in class about the programming syntax and organization while writing conditionals and loops. Since I have only really done java before, but I find that java and python are pretty similar. I did not use AI to complete of debug any of the exercise.
I used Chatgpt, but they did not have a link that I could copy, but what I asked was "how is for loops and if statements written in python" and it showed me examples of code.

Week 3
This week I used Ai while working on this weeks exercise to debug a couple times when I had an error and I was kind of confused what the error was.
I used Chatgpt, but they did not have a link that I could copy, but I put the line of code that was giving error and I would explain to Chatgpt what the error was saying and it would make suggestions to what the error was, which was sometimes wrong, but at least I figured it out.

Week 4
This week I used AI while on working on this weeks exercise to debug a few times when was getting an error message that I could not figure out.
I used Chatgpt, but they don't have links to copy, but I would put in the function that was having an error and it would help point out to me what could be the error.

Week 5
This week I used AI while working on this week exercise assignment to deg bug a few time when I was getting an error, but didn't exactly understand what it was flagging, as well as helping me with formating in the beginning.
I used Chatgpt, but they don't have links that you can copy, but i would put in the function that was giving me error or to see if the formating made sense.
